  - Cons: Higher upfront cost, requires more maintenance

### Server Specifications:
- For initial launch:
  - 2 vCPUs
  - 4 GB RAM
  - 50 GB SSD storage
- Scale up based on traffic and performance metrics

### Load Balancing:
- Implement load balancing for improved performance and reliability
- Consider using the cloud provider's built-in load-balancing services

### Backup and Disaster Recovery:
- Daily automated backups
- Implement a disaster recovery plan with a recovery time objective (RTO) of 4 hours

### Monitoring and Alerting:
- Set up comprehensive monitoring for server health, application performance, and lead generation metrics
- Configure alerts for critical issues (e.g., server down, abnormal lead submission patterns)

## Key Assumptions
1. **Stakeholder Availability**:
  - Assumption: Key stakeholders will be available for timely feedback and approvals throughout the development process
  - Mitigation: Establish clear communication channels and schedule regular check-ins
2. **Resource Availability**:

  - Mitigation: Have a contingency plan for bringing in additional resources if needed
3. **Third-party API Stability**:
  - Assumption: Third-party APIs (CRM, email service, etc.) will remain stable and accessible
  - Mitigation: Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
4. **Data Privacy Regulations**:
  - Assumption: No significant changes in data privacy regulations during the initial development phase
  - Mitigation: Stay informed about upcoming regulations and design the system with flexibility for future compliance needs
5. **Traffic Projections**:
  - Assumption: Initial traffic will not exceed 10,000 unique visitors per day
  - Mitigation: Design the system architecture to easily scale and monitor traffic closely after launch
6. **Content Availability**:
  - Assumption: Multilingual content will be provided by the client for supported languages
  - Mitigation: Provide a content template and guidelines to the client early in the process
7. **Browser Support**:
  - Assumption: The website needs to support the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
  - Mitigation: Implement cross-browser testing as part of the development process

## Risk Management
1. **Data Privacy Compliance**:
  - Conduct weekly audits of data handling processes
  - Implement data minimization principles
  - Set up automated data retention policies
2. **Integration Failures**:
  - Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms
  - Set up monitoring for integration health
  - Develop a fallback lead storage system
3. **Performance Under Load**:
  - Conduct load testing using Apache JMeter
  - Implement auto-scaling policies in cloud infrastructure
  - Optimize database queries and add necessary indexes
4. **Security Vulnerabilities**:
  - Conduct regular penetration testing
  - Implement automated security scans in CI/CD pipeline
  - Establish a responsible disclosure program

## Conclusion
This plan outlines the development of a lead generation website within a one-week timeframe, focusing on essential features to deliver a functional, secure, and scalable solution. It includes provisions for multilingual support, ongoing maintenance, server setup, and risk management. Following the launch, we will improve and optimize the website based on performance data and user feedback. Regular reviews and audits will ensure that the website remains effective, secure, and compliant with evolving regulations.
